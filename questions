2. The browser shows us a default django page that says "The install worked successfully! Congratulations!"
   and links to django tutorials and documentation. 

3. navigating to '/' gives us a 404 not found page and '/polls' shows us our index page we created and displays the text
    "Hello, world. You're at the polls page".


4. Migrations in django help us update our sql database we are using with our django app when we make changes to our models. 


5. We see the polls we created and we can add and change them. it also gives us the options for authentication and authorizatiion for users and groups
   We get custom models in the admin page by registering them to the django admin interface. 


6. You're looking at question 38, You're looking at the results of question 38, You're voting on question 38 is what it displays respectivly. 
   We get a 404 error if we put in a non integer. To change this we would allow our url parameters to take strings like this: 
    path('<str:question_id>/results/', views.results, name='results') for example. 


7. Can introduce bugs and break the application/website easier. changing the link url in area of the application can lead to the entire site breaking.
